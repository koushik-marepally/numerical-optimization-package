  Numerical Optimization Package
-------------------------------------

Computational tools have revolutionized the design process of engineering 
systems, but many established codes are unavailable for general public use, 
and may be largely expensive. This project aims at making such disruptive 
innovations in the field of design optimization as a freely available package,
and involving everyone into its creation and development.

The source code is implemented in C++, and plans to include other languages
based on our expertise. Contributions are welcome in this respect.
